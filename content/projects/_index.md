### Some of my work:

- [WallVerse](/projects/wallverse/): it is the first Python app I made. I used OOP, and it is multi-platform. 
- [BloodHound](/projects/bloodhound/): it is a graphing tool I used to map a fake Active Directory environment.
- [Waste Classification](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18u6l8P-upUWnwvkci0re-BdOgvMpPrkR/view?usp=sharing): I built a neural net for a machine learning course to separate images into recyclable and organic classes.
